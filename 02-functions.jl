## Loops

Like all julia syntax which introduces a local scope (i.e. a region where local variables can be defined, and used), a standard `for` loop ends with the `end` keyword:

```julia
for itervar in iterable
	# the loop body:
    # do stuff with itervar
	g(itervar)  # for example
    # itervar only exists inside this loop!
end
```

What's quite cool with julia iteration is that you can iterate over multiple things at once. Suppose we had this `Dict`:
"""

# ╔═╡ 142d25a9-e122-4253-8736-cdb10b123fc9

#

similarly, we have a standard *while* loop:

```julia
julia> while n < 4
		   n += 1
		   println("n is currently = $n")
       end
n is currently = 1
n is currently = 2

## A Running Example: Winsorized Mean

> I have taken this example from [Julia for Data Analysis](https://www.manning.com/books/julia-for-data-analysis), which I **highly** recommend.

The [Winsorized Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorized_mean) is an outlier-robust estimator for the central tendency of a distribution. We use it fairly often in applied work. For example, working with income data, it is quite frequent that we need to deal with unrealistically large (like 1.2 million Euros per month) or small (like -10000 Euros) values. To fix ideas, the $k=1$ winsorized mean for 10 numbers  $x_{(i)} <x_{(i+1)}$ is

$$\frac{x_{(2)} + x_{(2)} + x_{(3)} + \dots + x_{(8)} + x_{(9)} + x_{(9)}}{10}$$

i.e. we *replace* the $k$ smallest and largest numbers by their adjacent (higher or lower) neighbors.

## Functions

* Very important in julia: put all your work inside functions. 
* The compiler will be able to properly optimize your code only if you give it functions to analyse.
* Always keep in mind the [performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/) section!

**Two ways** to define your own functions:
"""

# ╔═╡ 12024ae2-c9cd-45d9-9bda-305e69cd6054
function f(x)   # `function` keyword, function name (f), args (if any) enclosed in ()

	# again, a local scope: y only visible in here
	# y  # by default, returns the last value

end

# ╔═╡ 4de3eb6d-c728-4d8d-aa79-38b06a3292c7

# ╔═╡ 83ab78f0-6160-4f4d-aa5c-d1d7322461a9
md"""
#

We *execute* function (we *call* the function) by typing its name and supplying the required arguments (again, if any, otherwise empty `()`):
"""

# ╔═╡ c465539c-e923-480d-abc7-cc9206f8f49a

# ╔═╡ fe13c7cd-bb36-450d-8865-08a53a915311

# ╔═╡ 95261af6-ad68-4987-bbfc-0d0ed79adfe5

#

### Keyword and Positional Arguments

1. You can have multiple arguments by position
2. We can set default values for positional arguments 
3. We can give keyword arguments (difference to 2.: you **must** use the keyword in the function call)
"""

notice that treating positional `y` like a keyword doesn't work, nor the other way around:

## Variable Scope

* Which variable is visible to the program where? 
* This is difficult and depends on many things. All languages are slightly different here, so it's important to know some general rules.
* The full set of rules are part of the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/#scope-of-variables), here we show a simple overview.

### Local vs Global Variables

* A variable you define in the REPL is global. That's convenient for exploration. Try this out, for example

```julia
julia> myf() = println(x)  # a function which prints object `x`
julia> x = 1  # an Int in global scope

julia> myf()
1

julia> x = :yea  
julia> myf()
yea
```

##

* it's great that we can switch the type of `x` so easily. That's what we mean with *dynamically typed* language - types of variables can change.
* However, for performance, that's a difficult problem: the compiler can't be sure of the data type of `x`, has to generate code that will work for all possible types for `x`, which means slow code. More on that later.
*

### Argument Passing Behaviour

* Julia passes arguments to functions *by reference*
* In particular, if what we give is a **mutable** object (like an array, for example), then the function changes the supplied object *in the caller*!
* This is quite cool, because we can modify objects *in-place* : think about a large array. It would be expensive to copy all the data from the caller into the function, do the job, then copy all the data back into the caller. Much better: leave the data where it is (in the caller), *modify it* as required in the function body, and copy nothing back and forth!

## First Implementation

Let's do the following in the `julia` REPL:

Suppose we have $$x = [10,1,6,4,5]$$, and $k=1$.
1. Create vector `x` by using the `[]` operators
2. Sort the vector from smallest to largest and save as `y`.
3. Use a loop to replace the smallest $k$ values by the $k+1$ smallest value and the largest $k$ values by the $N-k$ largest value, where $N$ is the length of `y`.
3. Inspect `y`.
4. Compute the mean of `y` by first creating variable `s = 0` to which we add all components of `y`, and then and dividing by $N$. This number is the $k$-times winsorized mean of input $x$.

## Wrapping Winsor in a Function

1. Copy our code from above into a function called `winsorized_mean(x,k)`.
2. Check that your function returns the correct (i.e. same) result as above when called with `winsorized_mean([10,1,6,4,5],1)`.

q(md"""
Newton's square root algorithm says that in order to compute $\sqrt{a} , a> 0$ up to arbitrary precision, you start with *any* given estimate $x >0$ of $\sqrt{a}$, and then you update your guess via

$$x \leftarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{a}{x}\right)$$

you will very quickly find the correct result of $\sqrt{a}$. 

1. in a `.jl` file, define function `mysqrt_step(a,x)`, which returns the next guess for `x` as in the above formula.
2. Try out your function manually in the REPL to compute $\sqrt{4}$, by calling `mysqrt_step(4,6)`, and then repeatedly using the output of the function to replace the second argument (so, instead of the `6` you put what comes out of your function).
3. define a second function, `mysqrt(a,x; tol = 1e-8)`, which *iterates* on `mysqrt_step(a,x)` for *as long as the absolute distance* between two successive guesses for `x` is larger than the value set in keyword argument `tol`. Make the function return a tuple `(x,iters)`, where `iters` is the number of iterations the function needed to converge to the true value.
4. Finally, 😓, write a function `sqrt_table()` which takes values for `a = 2:10`, and uses initial guesses `x = a^2`, and prints the output of `mysqrt(a,x)` to the following table, and onto your terminal. You want to get this output:
```
julia> sqrt_table()
 a     mysqrt       sqrt Iterations 
 2   1.414214   1.414214          6 
 3   1.732051   1.732051          7 
 4   2.000000   2.000000          8 
 5   2.236068   2.236068          8 
 6   2.449490   2.449490          9 
 7   2.645751   2.645751          9 
 8   2.828427   2.828427          9 
 9   3.000000   3.000000         10 
10   3.162278   3.162278         10 
```
Let me help you a bit to get that table output printed nicely. Here is what I did, which uses standard [formatted printing](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Printf/): the `%2s` would mean *2 string characters*, the `%10d` means 10 digits, the `\n` means *new line*, etc...

```julia
using Printf  # use the Printf package (built-in)
function sqrt_table()
    @printf("%2s %10s %10s %10s \n", "a", "mysqrt", "sqrt", "Iterations")
    for a in 2:10
        tmp = mysqrt(a,a^2)
        @printf("%2d %10f %10f %10d \n", a, tmp[1], sqrt(a), tmp[2])
    end
end
```

1. Positional arguments can have default values (like `y` here)
2. Keyword arguments **must be given with the keyword** when calling
3. Keyword arguments are given after a semicolon in the definition in a `name = value` fashion.

Local scopes are introduced by the following:
1. Functions and anonymous functions and `do...end` blocks
1. `for` and `while` loops
1. `try...catch` blocks
1. Comprehensions

It's important to know that `if...end` blocks as well as `begin...end` blocks do **not** introduce a local scope, hence variables will *leak* outside of that construct. Of course, having an `if...end` block *inside* a function does no harm at all.
